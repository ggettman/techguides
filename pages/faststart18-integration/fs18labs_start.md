# Experience How to Integrate Cloud Applications and Expose Them as APIs Using App Connect

## Overview
IBM® App Connect helps you automate workflows and integrate data, applications and APIs across hybrid cloud environments.

In this lab we focus on the App Connect offering which provides features for simple, guided app-to-app integration. With IBM App Connect you can link your applications so that when something happens in one application, other relevant applications get updated automatically, so you can:

* Stop wasting time on repetitive manual tasks
* Use this intuitive business tool to take back control
* Link your apps in a few simple steps

This exercise demonstrates the key integration capabilities of App Connect. Because this product is a cloud based SaaS offering you can explore it yourself easily from anywhere.

## Meet Paradise Audiophiles (Fictional)
Paradise Audiophiles is a high-end HiFi manufacturer, with 50 years of history building the best in high quality audio and home cinema equipment. They started small, with artisan attention to detail, components and sound quality. They’ve grown over the years building on this reputation, and are embracing new technologies and business approaches.

5 years ago they realised they needed to make a big change to keep up with the market, and they merged with a speaker manufacturer, Big Blue Tweeters, with an overlapping customer base. The best engineers from the two companies joined forces to design their latest range. They took a radically different approach building compact visually beautiful products that fit into modern digital lifestyles – as well as providing the purity of sound both companies are renowned for.

They sell through a network of small independent dealers, and target the mid to high level market – with individual products such as selling from $500 to in excess of $20,000.

Cassie has just been assigned to a new project team where she has taken on a new role as an integration developer. The project has very recently gone live with SAP Hybris, and the decision was made by the project lead to use Salesforce.com as the CRM System of Record, and to make sure that Hybris and Salesforce are keeping information in sync.

The exercises are based upon Chrome as the default browser so it is suggested this be used.
