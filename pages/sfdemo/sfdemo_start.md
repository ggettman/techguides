If you have not used Salesforce before, please start with [Step 0](sfdemo_step0.html) to create a Developer Account.

If you already have a Developer Account, there is still some object configuration required to run the demo successfully, so please start with [Step 0.2](sfdemo_step0.html#customize-salesforce-objects).
