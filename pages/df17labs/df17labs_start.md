# Experience How to Integrate Cloud Applications and Expose as APIs Using App Connect

## Overview
IBM® App Connect helps you automate workflows and integrate data, applications and APIs across hybrid cloud environments.

In this Lab we focus on the App Connect offering which provides features for simple, guided app-to-app integration. With IBM App Connect you can link your applications so that when something happens in one application, other relevant applications get updated automatically, so you can:

* Stop wasting time on repetitive manual tasks
* Use this intuitive business tool to take back control
* Link your apps in a few simple steps

These short exercises demonstrate the key integration capabilities of App Connect. Because this product is a cloud based SaaS offering you can explore it yourself easily from anywhere.

## Meet Paradise Audiophiles (Fictional)
Paradise Audiophiles is a high-end Hifi manufacturer, with 50 years of history building the best in high quality audio and home cinema equipment. They started small, with artisan attention to detail, components and sound quality. They’ve grown over the years building on this reputation, and are embracing new technologies and business approaches.

5 years ago realised they needed to make a big change to keep up with the market, and they merged with a speaker manufacturer Big Blue Tweeters with an overlapping customer base. The best engineers from the two companies joined forces to design their latest range. They took a radically different approach building compact visually beautiful products that fit into modern digital lifestyles – as well as providing the purity of sound both companies are renowned for.

They sell through a network of small independent dealers, and target the mid to high level market – with individual products such as selling from $500 to in excess of $20,000. 

##	Choose your scenario

Work through both scenarios if you have time, or jump to the one that interests you most. If you don’t manage to complete them, you can always do using your own trial account when you return home. See the end of this guide for more details.

***Integration Scenario 1 – Connect your Applications***

![](./images/df17labs/cassie.png) Cassie is a rising star in the marketing department. She is always looking for new digital tools to engage with customers, and has recently started using a SaaS service called Mailchimp to revolutionise email marketing within Paradise Audiophiles. However, she is frustrated with how much time she spends sifting through responses, and reconciling them with their Salesforce CRM system.

***Integration Scenario 2 – Create an API using Flows***

![](./images//df17labs/kirk.png) Kirk is responsible for keeping track of Paradise Audiofiles dealer network and registered customer base in their CRM system, sitting within a team of business analysts. Since the merger with Big Blue Tweeters they have reconciled their dealer information into Salesforce. He is working on a project with a business partner to build a mobile app for their dealers to register service requests, and they need an API. Kirk has done some coding before, but he isn’t a developer.

The exercises are based upon Chrome as the default browser so it is suggested this be used.
